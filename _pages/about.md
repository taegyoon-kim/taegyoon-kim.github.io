I am a Dual-title PhD student in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. My primary research interests center around applying network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms to achieve a better understanding of how social media influences individuals political behavior and aggregrate political outcomes such as mass polarization. I am advised by Bruce Desmarais.

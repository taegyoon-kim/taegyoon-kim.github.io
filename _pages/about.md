I am a postdoctoral fellow at [the Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) at [the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu), led by [Dashun Wang](https://www.dashunwang.com). I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu). I was advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com).

My research centers around applying statistical and computational methods (natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis) as well as experiments (survey, field) to achieve a better understanding of digital politics, political communication, polarization, public policy, and the intersection of science and politics, mainly focused on the United States. 

One of my key substantive interests lies in contentious politics and polarization in the U.S. In one paper, published in _Political Science Research and Methods_, I detect tweets threatening violence against politicians and examine key substantive patterns associated with those tweets. This paper won the 2021 John Sprague Award from the APSA Political Networks Section. In another paper, I conduct a survey experiment to examine how partisan elites' rhetoric threatening political violence influences individuals' support for political violence.

Another stream of my research examines networked online communication of U.S. state legislators - a key actor in public policymaking in the U.S. With my collaborators, I examine the online communication networks of state legislators, their public speech on social media, and public policy leadership and diffusion. For instance, with my collaborators in [State Policy Analysis Project](https://sites.psu.edu/spap/), I examine how state legislators frame and respond to the pandemic with a focus on partisan heterogeneities (published in _Legislative Studies Quarterly_).  

At the Center for Science of Science and Innovation, my current research centers around the intersection of politics and science. I examine scientists' engagement in public policymaking, public perceptions of science, and policy citation networks.

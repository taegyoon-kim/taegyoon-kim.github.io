I am a Dual-title PhD student in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. My primary research interests center around applying statistical and computational methods (network analysis, natural langauge processing, and machine laerning) to achieve a better understanding of how social media influences individuals' political attitude and behavior. I am advised by Bruce Desmarais.

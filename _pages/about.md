I am a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Penn State University, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. I am advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com) and a member of [Governance and Administration in Networks (GAiN) Lab](http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html) and [State Policy Analysis Project](https://sites.psu.edu/spap/). My primary research areas center around applying statistical and computational methods (natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis) as well as experiment to achieve a better understanding of partisanship, polarization, and extremism, focused on United States. 

In my dissertation, I identify tweets threatening violence against opposing partisans, examine key substantive dimensions associated with such threats, and investigate their causes and consequences. My dissertation brings attention to violent partisan hostility in the contemporary U.S. politics and sheds new light on political polarization and extremist online political communication. In addition, my other research projects extend to online communication of U.S. policymakers on highly contentious public policy agendas, such as the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination, complementing my substantive focus on polarization and extremism.

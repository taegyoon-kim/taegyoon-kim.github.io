I am a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Penn State, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. I am advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com) and a member of [Governance and Administration in Networks (GAiN) Lab](http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html).

My primary research areas center around applying statistical and computational methods (network analysis, text analysis, and machine learning) as well as experiments to achieve a better understanding of the diffusion of political information in online communication and how it affects poltical attitude and behavior. I also study political elites' online communication to understand how public policies are developed and spread within and across state borders.

In [my dissertation project](https://taegyoon-kim.github.io/research/), I build a method for automatic detection of violent political rhetoric on Twitter using ML/NLP and investigate its causes and consequences for inter-partisan relationships. As part of [the State Policy Analysis Project](https://sites.psu.edu/spap/), I investigate how state legislators respond to the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter and the diffusion of state policies related to the pandemic.

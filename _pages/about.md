I am an assistant professor at [School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences](https://hss.kaist.ac.kr) and a joint professor at [Graduate School of Data Science](https://gsds.kaist.ac.kr), [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/). 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [the Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) at [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu), Northwestern University. I completed my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Pennsylvania State University. 

My research revolves around the application of computational and statistical methods, complemented by experimental approaches, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of digital politics, political communication, and the interplay between science, policy, and politics. 

I am looking for motivated students who are enthusiastic about integrating theoretical insights with computational and statistical methods to leverage large-scale data for M.S. or Ph.D. degrees in Computational Social Science or Data Science. Recruitment will be through both School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences and Graduate School of Data Science.

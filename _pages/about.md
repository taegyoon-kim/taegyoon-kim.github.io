I am an assistant professor at [the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences](https://hss.kaist.ac.kr) and a joint professor at [the Graduate School of Data Science](http://gsds.kaist.ac.kr/insiter.php?design_file=1246.php), [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/). 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [the Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) at [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu), Northwestern University. I completed my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Pennsylvania State University. 

My research revolves around the application of computational and statistical methods, complemented by experimental approaches, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of digital politics, political communication, and the interplay between science, policy, and politics. You can see my published and ongoing works [here](https://taegyoon-kim.github.io/research/).

For 2024 Fall, I am looking for highly motivated students in social sciences who are enthusiastic about integrating theoretical insights with computational and statistical methods to leverage large-scale data. Recruitment will be through both the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences and the Graduate School of Data Science. If you are interested in working with me, reach out to me at taegyoon@kaist.ac.kr.

Thank you very much.

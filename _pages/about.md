I am a postdoctoral fellow at [the Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) at [the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu). I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu). I was advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com).

My research centers around applying statistical and computational methods (natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis) as well as experiments (survey, field) to achieve a better understanding of digital communication, polarization, public policy, and the intersection of science and politics, focused on the United States. 

One of my key substantive interests lies in contentious partisan politics in the U.S. In one paper, published in _Political Science Research and Methods_, I detect tweets threatening violence against politicians and examine key substantive patterns associated with those tweets. This paper won the 2021 John Sprague Award from the APSA Political Networks Section. In another paper, I conduct a survey experiment to examine how partisan elites' rhetoric threatening political violence influences individuals' support for political violence.

Another stream of my research examines networked online communication of U.S. state legislators - a key actor in public policymaking. For instance, with my collaborators in [State Policy Analysis Project](https://sites.psu.edu/spap/), I examine how state legislators frame and respond to the pandemic with a focus on partisan heterogeneities (published in _Legislative Studies Quarterly_).  

Recently, I am working on how politics shapes the development and spread of scientific knowledge.

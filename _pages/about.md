Welcome! I am a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Penn State University, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. I am advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com) and a member of the [Governance and Administration in Networks (GAiN) Lab](http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html) and the [State Policy Analysis Project](https://sites.psu.edu/spap/). My research centers around applying statistical and computational methods (natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis) as well as experiments to achieve a better understanding of partisanship, polarization, and extremism, especially in the United States. 

In my dissertation, I identify tweets threatening violence against opposing partisans, examine key substantive dimensions associated with such threats, and investigate their causes and consequences. My dissertation brings attention to violent partisan hostility in contemporary U.S. politics and sheds new light on political polarization and extremist online political communication. The first chapter of my dissertation, [Violent Political Rhetoric on Twitter](https://github.com/taegyoon-kim/violent_political_rheotric_on_twitter/blob/master/Violent%20Political%20Rhetoric%20on%20Twitter.pdf), won [the 2021 John Sprague Award from the American Political Science Association Political Networks Section](https://www.apsanet.org/STAFF/Membership-Workspace/Organized-Sections/Organized-Section-Awards/Organized-Section-Awards/Section-41).

My other research project, I examine the online communication network of U.S. state legislators and how it relates to highly contentious public policy issues, such as the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccinations, complementing my substantive focus on partisanship, polarization, and extremism.

Welcome! I am a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Penn State University, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. I am advised by [Bruce Desmarais](http://brucedesmarais.com) and a member of the [Governance and Administration in Networks (GAiN) Lab](http://brucedesmarais.com/lab.html) and the [State Policy Analysis Project](https://sites.psu.edu/spap/). My research centers around applying statistical and computational methods (natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis) as well as experiments to achieve a better understanding of digital politics, polarization, contentious politics, and public policy, especially in the United States. 

In my dissertation, I identify tweets threatening violence against opposing partisans, examine key substantive dimensions associated with such threats, and investigate their causes and consequences. My dissertation brings attention to violent partisan hostility in contemporary U.S. politics and sheds new light on political polarization and extremist online political communication. The first chapter of my dissertation, [Violent Political Rhetoric on Twitter](https://github.com/taegyoon-kim/violent_political_rheotric_on_twitter/blob/master/Violent%20Political%20Rhetoric%20on%20Twitter.pdf), won [the 2021 John Sprague Award from the American Political Science Association Political Networks Section](https://www.apsanet.org/STAFF/Membership-Workspace/Organized-Sections/Organized-Section-Awards/Organized-Section-Awards/Section-41) and is forthcoming in *Political Science Research and Methods*.

In my collaborative research, I examine U.S. state legislators' online communication networks and how they relate to highly contentious public policy issues, such as the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccinations. In [one paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/lsq.12367), published in *Legislative Studies Quarterly*, we investigate how state legislators frame and respond to the pandemic with a focus on partisan heterogeneities. This line of research illuminates networked online communication among state legislators and how it relates to the management of public health, contributing to the fields of public policy, legislative politics, health politics, and state politics.

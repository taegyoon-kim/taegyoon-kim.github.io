I am a Dual-title PhD student in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. My primary research interests center around applying statistical and computational methods (network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning) as well as experiments to achieve a better understanding of political attitude and behavior on social media. I am advised by Bruce Desmarais.

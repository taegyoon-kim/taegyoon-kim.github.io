Welcome! I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) at the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management. I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science](https://polisci.la.psu.edu) and [Social Data Analytics](https://soda.la.psu.edu) at Pennsylvania State University. 

My research centers around applying statistical and computational methods (natural language processing, machine learning, network analysis) as well as experiments (survey, field) to achieve a better understanding of digital communication, polarization, public policy, and the intersction of science and politics, focused on the United States.

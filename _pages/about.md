I am a Dual-title PhD student in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State, expecting to finish my degree in 2022. My primary research interests center around applying network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to achieve a better understanding of how social media influences individuals' political attitude and behavior. I am advised by Bruce Desmarais.

My dissertation project examines how political interaction among individuals with different political affiliation influences their opinion on major political issues and attitude toward the members of opposing group(s). In particular, I focus on the effects of aggressive langauge (widely known as incivility or hate speech).

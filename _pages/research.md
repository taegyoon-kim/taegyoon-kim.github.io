## Dissertation Project

Despite the initial optimism concerning the democratic potential of social media such as Facebook and Twitter, recent years have seen increasing concerns about the aggressive nature of political communication on those platforms. Although much scholarly attention has been paid to uncivil and hateful political discussion between political opponents, little is known about, perhaps, the most worrisome type of political communication: violent political rhetoric. Social media posts containing violent political rhetoric draw public attention not only because it is normatively undesirable in itself but also because such posts can spread via multiple chains of communication networks, thereby exposing many users to disturbing content. The spread of and exposure to such content is discomforting due to its potential for creating a combative climate of political discussion on social media and exacerbating inter-partisan conflict. 

Given the gravity of the problem, I set out to explore the spread, causes, and consequences of violent political rhetoric on social media. Focusing on the role of morality and emotions for extreme partisanship, I propose two theoretical claims. First, I claim that contentious politics revolving around moral issues evoke strong emotional responses, encouraging individuals to express their violent partisanship and spread corresponding messages on social media. Second, I argue that exposure to such violent partisan expressions influence affective polarization by evoking emotions such as anger and shame. Together, the following three papers shed new light on aggressive online political communication, mass political polarization, and the role of morality and emotions on politics.

In the first paper, I develop a method for automatic detection of violent political rhetoric. I apply the method to collect a data set of tweets containing violent political rhetoric, spanning the 16-week period surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election. Using the data set, I investigate the characteristics and the spread of violent political rhetoric on Twitter. In the second paper, I conduct an experiment to investigate the effects of exposure to threats of political violence on social media users' affective polarization. I argue that, while violent threats from an out-group member leads to affective polarization by inducing negative emotions (e.g., anger) toward the out-group, threats from an in-group member contributes to affective de-polarization by evoking shame or guilt. In addition, I examine the moderating effect of the social status of those who deliver violence-promoting content. I test my arguments using a two (threat vs. non-threat) $\times$ two (in-party vs. out-party) experiment. In the third paper, I explore why the mass use violent political rhetoric on Twitter. I investigate the relationship between offline political events and violent political rhetoric on Twitter. I claim that offline political events concerning moralized political issues often evoke lethal partisanship, resulting in the rise of violent rhetoric as a means for extreme partisan expression.

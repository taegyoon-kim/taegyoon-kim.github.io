## Dissertation Project

Despite the initial optimism concerning the democratic potential of social media such as Facebook and Twitter, recent years have seen increasing concerns about the vitriolic nature of political communication on those platforms. Although much scholarly attention has been paid to uncivil and hateful political discussion between political opponents, little is known about, perhaps, the most worrisome type of political communication: threats of political violence. Most evidently, and importantly, social media posts containing threats of political violence draw public attention because such posts have often been a harbinger of physical violence leading to the deaths of innocent citizens: many events of politically motivated physical violence were preceded by social media posts alluding or announcing the perpetrator's intent. This alone provides us compelling reason to study how to detect and possibly predict social media content containing threats of political violence. Not only so, social media posts threatening political violence can spread via multiple chains on communication networks, thereby exposing many users to the appalling intention. The spread of and exposure to such content are discomforting due to its potential for creating a combative climate of political discussion on social media. Given the gravity of the problem, this dissertation sets out to explore the prevalence, spread, and consequences of threats of political violence on social media and predict its future occurrence. The first essay introduces an automated method to detect Tweets containing threats of political violence on a large scale relying on machine learning and natural language processing and investigate their spread on Twitter communication networks. In the second essay, I conduct an experiment to investigate the effects of threats of political violence on social media users' affective polarization. In particular, I test how the source of threats (either from the ingroup or from the outgroup) and the status of one's group (either advantaged or disadvantaged) interact to shape the level of affective polarization. The last essay builds a model to predict the occurrence of threats of political violence on Twitter from a network perspective. Together, these three essays shed new light on vitriolic political discussion, political polarization, and detection and prevention of online political violence.

### Network of Uncivil Online Communication: the Case of the Impeachment Inquiry  [[Paper and Code]](https://github.com/taegyoon-kim/Course-Project-SoDA502-STAT597)

* How does uncivil political content spread on social media? Although there is mounting evidence that political incivility on social media is prevalent and can compromise the quality of democracy, we know little about how uncivil political content spreads on social media networks. In this paper, I examine how uncivil and civil users are connected in the communication network on Twitter. Do uncivil users associate with uncivil ones and civil users associate with civil ones? Based on the network of Twitter users engaged in the discussion of impeachment inquiry, I test the effect of incivility homophily and compare it with ideological incivility in terms of their substantive effect. To do so, I rely on a dataset of tweets containing the keyword, impeachment, and identify uncivil and civil users from the tweets using a ML classifier. Once the following network among uncivil and civil users are identified, I conduct visual, descriptive, and statistical analyses (ERGM) on the presence of incivility homophily. The results suggest that there is little to no evidence of incivility homophily whereas ideological homophily finds strong evidence.

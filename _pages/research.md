### Network Dynamics of Spread of Politically Violent Content on Twitter
* Despite the prevalence of  on social media and its implications for mass political polarization, there is surprisingly little scholarly effort to examine the actual status of the phenomenon. Unlike the prevalence and spread of others forms of problematic online content (e.g., fake news or hyperpartisan news) that attracted substantial attention, little is known about how prevalent aggressive politically vilent content is and how it spreads on social media. Thus, there is urgent need of descriptive analysis on politically violent content on social media. This paper fills the gap by answering two questions. First, how prevalent is exposure to politically violent content? Second, how far does such content spread on social media networks? 

### Political  Polarization  on  Social  Media:  Incivility  and  the  Effects  of  Pro-  and  Counter-attitudinalExposure
* How does exposure to political content affect political polarization on social media? Despite the initial concerns voiced about the potential of social media to breed political echo-chambers, there are increasing acknowledgements that there is also a substantial degree of exposure to counter-attitudinal content on social media. Focusing on the impact of two-sided communication on social media, a large body of research investigates the effects of exposure to pro and counter-attitudinal content on political polarization. At the same time, another body of research examines the effects of incivility on political polarization. Building on the theories in psychology, communication, and political science, I test a series of hypotheses concerning the interaction between pro and counter-attitudinal exposure and (in)civility: Does pro-attitudinal exposure on social media cause political polarization? If so, how does the level of incivility in pro-attitudinal content affect the latter's relationship with political polarization? Does encountering counter-attitudinal content on social media lead to depolarization? If so, does incivility attenuate the depolarizing effects of counter-attitudinal exposure and/or even generate backlash? To test these hypotheses, I conduct an online experiment where participants' newsfeed on social media is manipulated to expose them to varying levels of counter-attitudinal exposure and incivility. 

### Forecasting Political Aggression on Social Media: A Network Analytic Approach
* Despite many attempts to detect aggressive content on social media, research on how to forecast the instances of aggressive behavior is relatively rare. The goal of the paper is to forecast the occurrence of political aggression on Twitter. I build a network of political aggression where directed edges stand for the instances of political aggression from a perpetrator node who directs a politically aggressive tweet at victim node. Building on the literature identifying significant predictors of political aggression including node attributes and network characteristics, I create an edge-forecasting model for political aggression.

### Network of Uncivil Online Communication: the Case of the Impeachment Inquiry
* How does uncivil political content spread on social media? Although there is mounting evidence that political incivility on social media is prevalent and can compromise the quality of democracy, we know little about how uncivil political content spreads on social media networks. In this paper, I examine how uncivil and civil users are connected in the communication network on Twitter. Do uncivil users associate with uncivil ones and civil users associate with civil ones? Based on the network of Twitter users engaged in the discussion of impeachment inquiry, I test the effect of incivility homophily and compare it with ideological incivility in terms of their substantive effect. To do so, I rely on a dataset of tweets containing the keyword, impeachment, and identify uncivil and civil users from the tweets using a ML classifier. Once the following network among uncivil and civil users are identified, I conduct visual, descriptive, and statistical analyses (ERGM) on the presence of incivility homophily. The results suggest that there is little to no evidence of incivility homophily whereas ideological homophily finds strong evidence.

### The Effect of Partisanship on the Perception of Electoral Institutions: Analysis of Tweets about the Electoral College
* Legitimacy endowed to electoral institutions that guarantee free and fair competition is fundamental to the stability of democracy. Democracy requires people to agree upon a set of institutions that translate the popular will to the political arena and impose accountability to politicians. Focusing on partisanship, I argue that peopleâ€™s perception of the legitimacy of electoral institutions is affected by whether or not they provide short-term partisan advantages. When an electoral institution is considered to disadvantage their in-group, partisans might question its legitimacy. In contrast, they can unquestioningly support it when they consider it to provide partisan benefits to their in-group. I examine an electoral institution in the U.S.: the Electoral College (EC, hereafter). Employing a dictionated-based sentiment analysis on tweets posted around two presidential elections in 2012 and 2016, I test whether Twitter users changed (or kept) their attitudes about EC depending on whether or not it is considered to have advantaged their partisan candidate in the elections. The results show that Democrats who lost their EC vote but not the popular vote in 2016 expressed more negative emotions than Republicans after the 2016 election while there was no such divergence after the 2012 election where Democrats (Obama) won both the EC vote and the popular vote.

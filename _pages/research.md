## Network Dynamics of Spread of Politically Aggressive Content on Twitter

* Despite the prevalence of aggressive political communication on social media and its implications for mass political polarization, there is surprisingly little scholarly effort to examine the actual status of the phenomenon. Unlike the prevalence and spread of others forms of problematic online content (e.g., fake news or hyperpartisan news) that attracted substantial attention, little is known about how prevalent aggressive political content is and how it spreads on social media. Thus, there is urgent need of descriptive analysis on political aggression on social media. This paper fills the gap by answering two questions. First, how prevalent is exposure to aggressive political content? Second, how far does such content spread on social media networks? 

## The Effects of Online Incivility on Political Polarization: An Experimental Approach

* How does exposure to political content affect political polarization on social media? Despite the initial concerns voiced about the potential of social media to breed political echo-chambers, there are increasing acknowledgements that there is also a substantial degree of exposure to counter-attitudinal content on social media. Focusing on the impact of two-sided communication on social media, a large body of research investigates the effects of exposure to pro and counter-attitudinal content on political polarization. At the same time, another body of research examines the effects of incivility on political polarization. Building on the theories in psychology, communication, and political science, I test a series of hypotheses concerning the interaction between pro and counter-attitudinal exposure and (in)civility: Does pro-attitudinal exposure on social media cause political polarization? If so, how does the level of incivility in pro-attitudinal content affect the latter's relationship with political polarization? Does encountering counter-attitudinal content on social media lead to depolarization? If so, does incivility attenuate the depolarizing effects of counter-attitudinal exposure and/or even generate backlash? To test these hypotheses, I conduct an online experiment where subjects' following network is manipulated to expose them to varying levels of counter-attitudinal exposure and incivility. 

## Forecasting Political Aggression on Social Media: A Network Analytic Approach

* Despite many attempts to detect aggressive content on social media, research on how to forecast the instances of aggressive behavior is relatively rare. The goal of the paper is to forecast the occurrence of political aggression on Twitter. I build a network of political aggression where directed edges stand for the instances of political aggression from a perpetrator node who directs a politically aggressive tweet to a victim node attacked by the perpetrator node. Utilizing  machine learning models, I identify tweets of political aggression. Building on the literature identifying significant predictors of political aggression including node attributes and network characteristics, I create an edge-forecasting model for political aggression on Twitter.

> Violent hostility between ordinary partisans is undermining American democracy. Social media is blamed for rhetoric threatening violence against political opponents and implicated in offline political violence. Focusing on Twitter, I propose a method to identify such rhetoric and investigate substantive patterns associated with it. Using a data set surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election, I demonstrate that violent tweets closely track contentious politics offline, peaking in the days preceding the Capitol Riot. Women and Republican politicians are targeted with such tweets more frequently than non-Republican and men politicians. Violent tweets, while rare, spread widely through communication networks, reaching those without direct ties to violent users on the fringe of the networks. This paper is the first to make sense of violent partisan hostility expressed online, contributing to the fields of partisanship, contentious politics, and political communication.

**Attention to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Twitter: Partisan Differences among U.S. State Legislators** <br>

> Subnational governments in the United States have taken the lead on many aspects of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Variation in government activity across states offers the opportunity to analyze responses in comparable settings. We study a common and informative activity among state officials—state legislators’ attention to the pandemic on Twitter. We find that legislators’ attention to the pandemic strongly correlates with the number of cases in the legislator’s state, the national count of new deaths, and the number of pandemic-related public policies passed within the legislator’s state. Furthermore, we find that the degree of responsiveness to pandemic indicators differs significantly across political parties, with Republicans exhibiting weaker responses, on average. Lastly, we find significant differences in the content of tweets about the pandemic by Democratic and Republican legislators, with Democrats focused on health indicators and impacts, and Republicans focused on business impacts and opening the economy.

**Modeling State Legislator Networks on Twitter** <br>
With Ishita Gopal, Nitheesha Nakka, Bruce Desmarais <br>
> A lot of attention has been paid to studying the online activity of the members of the United States Congress. This scrutiny has not been extended to state legislators. Very few studies exist which catalogue why state legislators connect and communicate with one another online in the ways they do. Inspired by this question and building on studies which have analyzed online communication of members of national legislatures, this paper aims to systematically analyze state legislator relationships in the online environment. We collect original data for 4000+ legislators and study patterns of connection and communication of state legislators on Twitter. The results from this study will help better understand what motivates tie formation in the online environment and if these patterns of connection conform to or can predict offline relationships. We test the impact of variables such as party affiliation, state, chamber, cohort, gender, and policy area focus on the organization of these online networks. We look at three main types of networks that can arise due to participation on Twitter - follower, retweets and mentions. We also aggregate the ties to infer dynamics between states.

## Dissertation Project

Despite the initial optimism concerning the democratic potential of social media such as Facebook and Twitter, recent years have seen increasing concerns about the aggressive nature of political communication on those platforms. Although much scholarly attention has been paid to uncivil and hateful political discussion between political opponents, little is known about what is, perhaps, the most worrisome type of political communication: violent political rhetoric. Social media posts containing violent political rhetoric draw public attention not only because such rhetoric is normatively undesirable in itself but also because such posts can spread via multiple chains of communication networks, thereby exposing many users to disturbing content. The spread of and exposure to such content is discomforting due to its potential for creating a combative climate of political discussion on social media and exacerbating inter-partisan conflict. 

Given the gravity of the problem, I set out to explore the spread, causes, and consequences of violent political rhetoric on social media. Focusing on the role of morality and emotions in extreme partisanship, I propose two theoretical claims. First, I claim that contentious politics revolving around moral issues evoke strong emotional responses, encouraging individuals to express their violent partisanship and spread corresponding messages on social media. Second, I argue that exposure to such violent partisan expressions influences affective polarization by evoking emotions such as anger and shame. Together, the following three papers shed new light on aggressive online political communication, mass political polarization, violent extremism, and the role of morality and emotions in politics.

In the first paper, I develop a method for automatic detection of violent political rhetoric. I apply the method to collect a data set of tweets containing violent political rhetoric, spanning the 16-week period surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election. Using the data set, I investigate the characteristics and the spread of violent political rhetoric on Twitter. In the second paper, I conduct an experiment investigating how exposure to threats of political violence on social media influences users' affective polarization. I argue that, while violent threats from an out-group member leads to affective polarization by inducing negative emotions (e.g., anger) toward the out-group, threats from an in-group member contributes to affective de-polarization by evoking shame or guilt. In addition, I examine the moderating effect of the social status of those who deliver violence-promoting content. I test my arguments using a two (threat vs. non-threat) $\times$ two (in-party vs. out-party) experiment. In the third paper, I theorize that politicians prime moralized political issues to bolster their core support base, although it leads to violent partisan expression by evoking outrage. I test several implications of this theory using tweets from the 117th Congress.

## Dissertation Project

Despite  the  initial  optimism  concerning  the  democratic  potential  of  social  media  such  asFacebook and Twitter, recent years have seen increasing concerns about the vitriolic natureof political communication on those platforms. Although much scholarly attention has beenpaid to uncivil and hateful political discussion between political opponents,  little to noneis  known  about,  perhaps,  the  most  worrisome  type  of  political communication:  threats  ofpolitical violence.  Most evidently,  and importantly,  social media posts containing threatsof political violence draw public attention because such posts have often been a harbingerof  physical  violence  leading  to  the  deaths  of  innocent  citizens:  many  events  of  politicallymotivated physical violence were preceded by social media posts alluding or announcing theperpetrator’s intent.  This alone provides us compelling reason to study how to detect andpossibly predict social media content containing threats of political violence. Not only so, socialmedia posts threatening political violence can spread via multiple chains on communicationnetworks, thereby exposing many users to the appalling intention. The spread of and exposureto such content is discomforting due to its potential for creating a combative climate of politicaldiscussion on social media. Given the gravity of the problem, this dissertation set out to explorethe prevalence, spread, and consequences of threats of political violence on social media andpredict its future occurrence. The first essay introduces an automated method to detect Tweetscontaining threats of political violence on a large scale relying on machine learning and naturallanguage processing approaches and investigate their spread on communication networks.In the second essay, I conduct an experiment to investigate the effects of threats of politicalviolence on social media users’ affective polarization.  In particular, I test how the source ofthreats (either from ingroup or from outgroup) and the group status of those exposed (eitheradvantaged or disadvantaged) interact to shape the level of affective polarization. The last essaysets out build a model to predict the occurrence of threats of political violence on Twitter from anetwork perspective. Together, these three essays shed new light on vitriolic political discussion,political polarization, and detection and prevention of online political violence.
